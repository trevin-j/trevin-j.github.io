                My name is Trevin Jones. I'm a developer that loves leaning and experimenting with new things.
                This website is a place where you can learn a little bit about me and where I can show off some of my projects.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I grew up in Montana, and I have alwyas been fascinated with technology.
              I'm currently a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho studying Computer Science.
              I frequently consider myself self-taught in programming, but my courses at BYU-I have been so helpful in guiding my learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first experience with programming is working with TI-Basic on my TI-84 Plus CE as a freshman in high school.
              When I was a senior in high school, I finally began learning how to program with Python.
              Since then, I have spent time learning numerous other languages and technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love to develop software in my free time.
              I have several personal projects that I am always working on, and many of my projects can be found on my GitHub page.
              My first programming language was Python, but recently I have been enjoying working with several different languages.
              Right now C++ has to be my favorite, due to the unique challenges it throws at me.
