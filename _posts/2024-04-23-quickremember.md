I've recently published my first package to a real repository!
The project itself is very simple, but to some people like myself it may be rather useful.
I call it QuickRemember.
Essentially, it serves as a way to quickly make a note of something for later.

Whenever I'm working on my laptop, I'll often come across some little thing that I have to
remember for a little bit. It could be an API key, a temporary code of some sort, etc.
I typically open up a text editor really quickly and type in the thing I need to remember and
save it somewhere random hoping I'll remember where to look for it when the time comes.
Well... I got tired of the random text files cluttering my system and I wanted to be able to
make a note of things in the easiest way possible. Thus QuickRemember was born.

QuickRemember is a very simple command-line application (CLI) that was made to be intuitive
and easy to use. You can learn more about the project at [its site](https://trevinjones.com/quickremember/)
or [its github repository](https://github.com/trevin-j/quickremember/). The package is
published to PyPI and thus can be installed with `pip install quickremember`.

The package itself is very simple and may or may not receive updates over time, but it served
as an excellent way to teach me about packaging and distributing in Python. I've once
again transitioned to Linux as my main OS (Fedora, this time) and I love the way packages
are distributed in Linux far more than Windows.

Thanks for checking out this quick post and have a wonderful day!
