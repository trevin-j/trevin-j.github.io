        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
        Below is a list of some of my best projects that I have worked on, or am currently working on.
        Many of these projects are very much a work in progress, and I work on them whenever I get the chance to.
        Not all of my public projects are on this list, but you can find them on my <a href="https://github.com/trevin-j">GitHub</a> page.
        I also have several projects that I am working on that are not yet public.
        </p>

      <div class="container" id="fudgerunner">
        <h3>FudgeRunner</h3>
        <p>
          FudgeRunner is an interpreter for the <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfudge">Brainfudge</a> esoteric programming language.
          The interpreter was written in Java and therefore requires you to have Java installed to compile and run it.
          Included in the interpreter is the ability to interpret BF files and a fully functioning Brainfudge REPL.
          FudgeRunner runs in the command-line, and requires command line arguments to run.
        </p>
        <p>
          The repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/trevin-j/FudgeRunner">here</a>,
          which contains instructions for building and using the program.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container" id="fudgerunnerpp">
        <h3>FudgeRunner++</h3>
        <p>
          FudgeRunner++ is a Brainfudge interpreter and compiler written in C++.
          FudgeRunner++ supports live interpreting files, compiling files, and command-line REPL.
          Similarly to FudgeRunner, FudgeRunner++ runs in the command-line, and requires command line arguments to run.
          Instructions for usage can be found in the repository linked below.
          Compiling files is done by first compiling a BF file to a C file, then using GCC to compile the C file to an executable.
          Because of this, the executable is fully standalone and requires nothing else to run.
          Unfortunately, FR++ is untested on Mac and Linux currently, but Windows 10 and 11 are supported.

      <div class="container" id="sortingvisualizer">
        <h3>Sorting Visualizer</h3>
        <p>
          Sorting Visualizer is a fun little program written in C++, and using SFML, designed to visualize different sorting algorithms.
          While I haven't spent much time since I initially started this project, there are still some changes that would benefit this program.
          The program uses polymorphism to make it easier to add new sorting algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instructions for usage can be found in the repository <a href="https://github.com/trevin-j/SortingVisualizer">here</a>.

      <div class="container" id="html-builder">
        <h3>HTML Builder Library</h3>
        <p>
          HTML Builder is a C++ header-only library used for the generation of HTML.
          The repository contains good documentation for usage, and the library is quite small and easy to use.
          I initially created this library for me to use in my own markdown parser, but the parser is far from finished and is not public.

      <div class="container" id="datastructures">
        <h3>Data Structures Tutorial</h3>
        <p>
          This project consists of 3 short tutorials designed to teach you about stacks, linked lists, and trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can view the live site <a href="https://trevin-j.github.io/DataStructures">here</a>, or view the repository <a href="https://github.com/trevin-j/DataStructures">here</a>.

      <div class="container" id="eztts">
        <h3>EZTTS</h3>
        <p>
          EZTTS is a Python package for easily generating text to speech. The
          package is designed to be highly modular and supports multiple TTS APIs.
          With the wide variety of TTS tools out there, it can be hard to pick
          one to learn and use, so EZTTS takes several and puts them together
          with only the need to learn a single interface.

          I am also always working on new projects, more often than I update this page, so check back every once in a while, or check out my GitHub to see what I've been working on lately.
